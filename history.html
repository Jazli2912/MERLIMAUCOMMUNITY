                            <P>It is said that the Malays of old were very skilled in the art of wielding their special weapon, the keris. They practiced silat, pencak, or the art of self-defense every day. Each person had a keris as their personal weapon, carried wherever they went to defend themselves and oppose enemies. These kerises were kept and maintained. The way to maintain them was through "usap and limau." This means their kerises had to be rubbed with benzoin resin and massaged with lime. The tradition of "merlimau-ing" the keris still exists among the Malay community, especially those who possess heirloom kerises. This ceremony is called the "Merlimau Keris Ceremony." Every Friday night, their kerises must be limau-ed. During this ceremony, they gather at the house of the Tok Guru to limau the kerises. When asked, "Where are you going?", they would answer, "To limau," and eventually, the place became known as "Merlimau."

                            <P>In 1511, one of the Bugis leaders who migrated to Merlimau was Datuk Kaya Makmun. He originally cleared the forest to create residential areas. At that time, the interior or upstream of the Merlimau River was unexplored forest. The vast wilderness was said to be inhabited by wild animals, especially tigers. Tigers always threatened these new arrivals as they lived on the edge of dense forests. Therefore, Datuk Kaya directed his people to build fences to fend off attacks or dangers from tigers. In the old language, it was called "mara rimau," where they built fences to fend off tiger attacks that threatened their lives. They named this place Mara Rimau, which eventually became "Merlimau."
